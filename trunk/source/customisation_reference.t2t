= Defining new toolsets =

When defining a new toolset note the following expectations:

* The debug variant expects debugging symbols to be included in the
build process.
* The release variant expects no debugging symbols
* The DEBUG preprocessor macro will be set to 1 for debug variants
and 0 for release. It must always be defined.
