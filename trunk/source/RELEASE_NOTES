July 2010 Release 1.1beta
Code Revision Number: 30

Greatly improved reliability and better error reporting.

Important external changes are:

* first Windows version. Requires GNU make for interpreting 
generated makefiles.  Example settings for gcc and cl.

* auto-detecting the project root directory.  At the same time 
this also fixed a number of program bugs related to detecting 
directories.  The most significant of which was plugout failure 
when the project was all in a single directory or if no project 
directory existed.

* better issue reporting.  Common issues related to generating 
the build system are now reported by a dialog with some 
instruction as to possible solutions.

* writing the build files as UmlArtifacts into the bouml project.
The plugout creates a "tagged" section for each target and copies 
user text from between the sections.  This gives the ability to 
do some per-target customization outside the plugout (see 
documentation).

* improved build systems.  The generated build systems are now 
more consistent between styles.  The "checklist.t2t" now
documents the key features of the plugout along with the subversion
version that passed the acceptance test.

Internal changes:

* Rewrote the code to utilize only Qt containers and types.
